- The desktop viewpoint displays the top of an article with menu
- The tablet viewpoint removes the menu feature but keeps proportions
- The mobile breakpoint actually zooms out on the image allowing it to fill the screen

- The desktop for this site is so cool, it has running naturee videos behind a minimalist greeting screen
- The tablet version removes the footer bar as it runs on presets and uses a hamburger menu
- The mobile mode takes the minimalist approach further with the removal of the text next to the menu

- Susa Ventures has a smart menu that merely skips to the point and is full displayed on desktop
- Tablet mode reduces this to merely buttons, not sure if theres any animation
- On mobile, the squared dotted effect behind it most notieable as it removes columns instead of compression the image
